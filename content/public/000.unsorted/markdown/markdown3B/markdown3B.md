  substitutions:
    params_vars_title: Markdown Statements
    params_vars_modifier: are correct
    params_part1_ans1_value: You can play Videos in Markdown files.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: You cannot do this in pure Markdown.
    params_part1_ans2_value: The most common extension for Markdown files is .md
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: This is generally the most common, but there are many
      other extensions that are used, including `.txt`.
    params_part1_ans3_value: The most standard extension for Markdown files is .markdown
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: There is no official standard for the extension of
      Markdown files, but `.md` is generally the most commonly used, followed by `.markdown`.
    params_part1_ans4_value: You can run code in Markdown files
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: This is not possible in pure Markdown, but can be
      done in Jupyter Notebooks if there is a kernel that supports it.
    params_part1_ans5_value: You can resize images using Markdown
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: If you want to resize images, you will need to use
      HTML syntax, pure Markdown doesn't support it.
    params_part1_ans6_value: To create a horizontal line in Markdown, we use `**`
    params_part1_ans6_feedback: This will create bold text, not a horizontal line.
      You can do this by using 3 or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a new
      line.
    params_part1_ans7_value: To create a bulleted list in Markdown, we use `>`
    params_part1_ans7_feedback: This will create a block quote when put at the start
      of a line, not a bulleted list. You can do this by using any of `*`, `+`, or
      `-`.
