  substitutions:
    params_part1_option1_value: Axes should not be truncated to misrepresent differences
      between groups
    params_part1_option2_value: Focus attention on the data by removing distracting
      visual elements.
    params_part1_option3_value: When points are plotted on top of each other obscuring
      the density and distribution of the data.
    params_part1_option4_value: Plots should be informed by the data you have, the
      research question being asked, and the audience that cares.
    params_part1_option5_value: Colour can also be distracting if used inappropriately
      or poorly.
    params_part1_option6_value: The ideal plot is usually the most complex plot that
      your audience will understand.
    params_part1_option7_value: Colour can be used to encode information or for aesthetics/style/design.
    params_part1_option8_value: Figure sizes should be appropriate to see all the
      plot elements.
    params_part1_option9_value: There is more than one appropriate choice for each
      research question.
