# {{ params_vars_title }}
Note: This question is going test your ability to search for information on the internet.
This is intentional, and is not a trap.
You ARE ALLOWED to search for information for tests in this course.

Please remember that this is an open book, open-notes, and open-web test.
The only websites you cannot use are "cheating websites" like Chegg, CourseHero, Slader, Bartleby, etc...
Similarly, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) assistance such as ChatGPT is not permitted on assessments.
In general, if you (or someone else) has to pay for it, chances are it's a cheating website and is NOT permitted.
