#### **Dr. Firas Moosvi**

Firas Moosvi is a Lecturer at UBC Okanagan in the Computer Science, Math, Physics, and Statistics department.
He teaches courses in Physics, Data Science, and Computer Science at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
He has many research interests and they fall under three main umbrellas: medical imaging for applications in cancer, scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL), and learning analytics.
Most recently, he is looking at how the field of learning analytics can provide insight to surface and reduce inequities in STEM programs.
Firas has a deep appreciation for data visualization, active learning, and open source projects.<br><br><br>

#### **Dr. Jake Bobowski**

Jake is a Professor of Teaching in physics at UBC Okanagan.
In addition to teaching and Physics Education Research, he is interested in applying microwave techniques to study condensed matter systems. <br><br><br><br><br>

#### **Ava Cornell**

I am a fourth year honours physics student at UBC Okanagan. Throughout my degree, I have thoroughly enjoyed being a physics teaching assistant and tutor, which has caused me to develop an interest in making learning more accessible and less stressful for students. In my free time, I like to hike, camp, and socialize. <br><br><br>

#### **Abby Kiehlbauch**

I am a first year Bachelor of Arts student at UBCO planning to major in Computer Science. As it is my first year I don't have a specific area of interest, however my passions have always been mental health advocacy and social justice - I hope to find a way in which Computer Science can elevate those two fields. I am looking forward to further exploring the field of Computer Science in my next three years at UBCO. While I'm not studying or spending my days on Zoom I am usually reading, sewing, crocheting, or baking!

Hello, I’m Gavin! I just completed my second year enrolled in UBC Okanagan’s chemistry program, with a minor in data science. I’m very interested in helping making learning more accessible to others, as I have seen firsthand and through others how much mandatory textbooks and teaching tools can cost on top of tuition, and how much that can hamper learning, so helping more free quality education resources be available is an exciting opportunity for me to be a part of and lend my experience with python to this project! Further, across all the coding classes I have taken, the lack of smart, computer graded testing of code using easily available technology has always surprised me, so being able to help create a solution to this gap in educational resources is an exciting opportunity!

Outside of classes and education, I enjoy playing the trombone (and euphonium sometimes), as well as playing D&D 5e, and coding in python, anything from small automation scripts to larger projects, including data visualization. Also being from the pacific northwest, I love hiking and nature, as well mountains, especially Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Baker, and Mt. Rainer.

Hi everyone! My name is Borna, just completed my 2nd year studying business and computer science at UBC Vancouver. Aside from this project I'm also on the Investment team at Front Row Ventures, and hoping to go into product management, starting with an internship next Summer! Excited to work on this project, developing a large open problem bank with helpful feedback for questions that for me at least is very critical to my learning, while developing a variety of skills in this process. Besides work/school, I'm a big sports fan, especially Soccer and Basketball, and I also have my 2nd degree black belt in Taekwondo, you might also catch my playing story or online games with friends. Looking forward to working with everyone!

#### **Michael Kudla**

I am a PhD student in MedPhys. I am developing a patient specific technology suite for low cost imaging and surgical tool manufacturing (3D printed) for treatment of gynecological malignancies. I am into rock climbing and ski-touring. <br><br><br>
